This bot is built using Python, discord.py, and PostgreSQL as the backend database. Discord categories represent class sections, and every student is stored in the database with a fixed section. When a teacher types roll numbers like 3,7,12 in a section’s attendance channel, the bot automatically marks everyone present and those numbers absent for the day. It supports simple commands such as !sectionpdf to generate a daily attendance PDF, !studentstats to get a full student statistics report, !lowattendance 75 to list and tag students below a given percentage, and !exportexcel to download a complete Excel workbook with section-wise attendance history. The stack makes the system fast, reliable, and easy to use in real classrooms.
